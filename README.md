# Voice-ActivatedLanguageCorrectionAssistant
This project presents the development of a voice-activated assistant named "Grammar," designed to help users improve their spoken language by correcting grammatical errors and logical inconsistencies in their sentences. It listens for a designated wake word, records user speech, transcribes it into text, and provides corrected versions that are both grammatically correct and logically coherent.
